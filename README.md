# Study Timer for Programmers
Have you ever wanted to quickly start a timer in a terminal when you're about to study? This application makes that very simple.
Just run 'python3 code_timer.py' at the command line and you're set! Follow the on-screen prompt, if you'd like to end the timer.
## The BEST way to make sure you're meeting your study goals.
If you'd just like to see how long you've studied and to not sudy anymore:
    - Run the application.
    - View your 'studied time' at the top.
    - Press CTRL+C to close the app.
This will ensure you don't add anymore time to your timer for the day.
### NOTE: This app is very specific to computer science students, but it can be repurposed.
