# Study Timer for Programmers
 ![demo image](./demo/study_timer_demo.jpg?raw=true) <br />
Have you ever wanted to quickly start a timer in a terminal when you're about to study? This application makes that very simple.
Just run 'python3 code_timer.py' at the command line, and it's all right! Follow the on-screen prompt if you'd like to end the timer.
## Check time studied
If you'd like to see how long you've studied and not study anymore: <br/>
    - Run the application. <br />
    - View your 'studied time' at the top. <br />
    - Press CTRL+C to close the app. <br />
Exiting will ensure you don't add more time to your timer for the day.
### The Pomodoro Update
Recently, I updated the codebase to use the Pomodoro study technique. Using the Pomodoro technique requires 25 minutes of studying and a 5-minute break. To get around this new feature, use the "log time" script to add time.
