# Study Timer for Programmers
 ![demo image](./demo/study_timer_demo.jpg?raw=true) <br />
Have you ever wanted to quickly start a timer in a terminal when you're about to study? This application makes that very simple.
Just run 'python3 code_timer.py' at the command line and you're set! Follow the on-screen prompt, if you'd like to end the timer.
## Check time studied
If you'd just like to see how long you've studied and to not sudy anymore: <br/>
    - Run the application. <br />
    - View your 'studied time' at the top. <br />
    - Press CTRL+C to close the app. <br />
This will ensure you don't add anymore time to your timer for the day.
### NOTE: This app is very specific to computer science students, but it can be repurposed.
It's (currently) specific to computer science students because most people don't want to bother with a terminal.
